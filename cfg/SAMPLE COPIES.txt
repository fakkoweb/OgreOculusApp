.cfg files in this folder are used ONLY when OgreOculusApp is Configured as the Main Project.

Otherwise, cmake will detect if you don't have any .cfg file named after them in your top-level /cfg folder,
and will make a COPY for you on Configure phase for each missing file.

BUT THESE FILES ARE NOT USED if OgreOculusApp is Configured as a subproject.
